FreePiano is an opensource MIDI keyboard software.

At beginning, this soft is made just for myself, I just want a software that can load VSTi instruments, and plays like a piano using computer keyboard.

After version 1.0, I received lots of suggestions, which makes this software better and better. Thanks to all the suggestions.

If I could find a similar open source software, maybe I will just make modifications on that software. So FreePiano is opensource. I holp new ideas can be implemented on this software, if it is possible.
