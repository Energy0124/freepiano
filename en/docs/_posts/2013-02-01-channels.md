FreePiano have 16 input channels, and 16 output channels.

## What's the difference between input and output channels?

A input channel is what you send signal to, and then freepiano translated the signal to a MIDI message to a MIDI channel, that MIDI channel is called output channel in FreePiano.

Multiply input channels can have signals outputed to a same output channel, parameters of input channel (most are note transpose) is calculated on a note before sending to output. MIDI channel have no such thing like 'Transpose'.


Let's take a look at the channel options in FreePiano 1.8:

<div class="note info">
<h5>Different to other MIDI software</h5>
<p>Most parameters in freepiano is starting at 0, like channels are from 0-15, programs are from 0 to 127.</p>
</div>

## Parameters of Input channel
Most parameters of input channel is used to transpose notes:

<thead>
<tr>
  <td width="20%">Parameter</td>
  <td>Description</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Velocity</td>
  <td><p>Velocity when a note is pressed.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Transpose</td>
  <td><p>Different to key signature, Transpose only affact a input channel.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Follow key</td>
  <td><p>When checked, all notes is transposed to current key signature.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Octave</td>
  <td>Transpose by octaves(12 seminotes)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Output Channel</td>
  <td><p>Which channel the final MIDI message will send to.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Parameters of output channel
Output channel is MIDI channel, parameters translated into MIDI messages.

<tr>
  <td>Bank</td>
  <td><p>Controller 0 in MIDI, for controlling bank.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Program</td>
  <td><p>Program Change in MIDI, for select voice on a channel.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Sustain</td>
  <td><p>Controller 64 in MIDI, as sustain pedal.</p></td>
